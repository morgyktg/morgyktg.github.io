    <h2> About me </h2>

</html>
<p> My Mission in life is to us all my skills and passion for technology to actively contribute to 
a safer more secure digital world through a career in cybersecurity. Also, while having that 
interest I also have interest in the education and radiology field. I want to use my skills, love 
and patience pertaining to kids and my passion for instilling education into others to be an 
educator one day. My last mission is to go to school to get a degree in Radiology or a 
certificate to work as an ultrasound technician to fulfill my childhood dreams. Whether in a 
classroom, in tech or in Health care my ultimate goal is to serve others, making a 
meaningful impact, and to continue learning </p>
